Spring 2019 CS 201 Portfolio Project
When you first start the game, adjust your window to take up your full screen to ensure the best experience.
Follow the instructions given in each menu.
Note that whenever the board size is asked for or if another game is wanted to be played, the user should input integers only followed by enter.
Use the following link to download the dictionary.txt file from google drive. Save the file in the Project folder.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sw01QNlfFA5AQvPrKkWqbNm3r1aiM2zd/view?usp=sharing
The dictionary file should be titled dictionary.txt as that is what dictionaryLoad() looks for when trying to open in dictionary.c.
Use the sudo make operation in ubuntu to compile the project then run it using sudo ./Boggle
Sudo is necessary because of permissions.

When the board size is greater than 20, the board will toggle between rows and columns as the user moves across the board.
Also, the dictionary file includes plenty of abbreviations for common things.

The timer length can be found around line 293 in boardUI.c. By default it is set to elapsed<180.

The video demonstration can be found on YouTube at https://youtu.be/pZi-EH0YcJI
